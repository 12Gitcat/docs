Masternodes
==================

Dash is best known as the first cryptocurrency with a focus on anonymity
and transaction speed. What many people do not know is that these 
features are implemented on top of a network of dedicated servers known 
as masternodes, which gives rise to many exciting features not available
on conventional blockchains. These features include anonymous and 
instant transactions, as well as governance of the development of the 
Dash network through a monthly budget and voting. This in itself is a 
first in the crypto world, and the masternodes are necessary to achieve
the privacy and speed that Dash offers.
