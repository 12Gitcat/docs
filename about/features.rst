Whitepaper
==================

A whitepaper is a document often issued with the release of a new
cryptocurrency to explain its Unique Value Proposition and describe
details of how it will function. The Dash Whitepaper is frequently
updated, but this page also provides links to the original version and
translations.

Specifications
==================

-  Release date: 11PM EST, 18th January 2014 / No premine
-  X11 hashing algorithm: 11 rounds of scientific hashing functions
   (blake, bmw, groestl, jh, keccak, skein, luffa, cubehash, shavite,
   simd, echo)
-  Block reward is controlled by: 2222222/(((Difficulty+2600)/9)^2).
    Minimum base subsidy 5 Dash. Maximum 25 Dash.
-  CPU/GPU/ASIC mining
-  Block generation: 2.5 minutes
-  Difficulty Retargets using Dark Gravity Wave - Improved Kimoto
   Gravity Well - Exponential Moving Average weighted adjustment.
-  7.14% decrease in the number of coins generated per year
-  Total coins: `between 17.74M and
   18.92M <emission-rate>`__
-  Total coins: `between 17.74M and
   18.92M <emission-rate>`_
-  Total coins: :ref:`between 17.74M and
   18.92M <emission-rate>`
-  Total coins: :ref:`between 17.74M and
   18.92M (see `Emission Rate`_)
-  Total coins: between 17.74M and
   18.92M (see `Emission Rate`_)
-  Decentralized Masternode Network
-  Superior Transaction Anonymity using PrivateSend
-  Two-tier network using masternodes to form the second tier
-  Instant transactions (InstantSend) made possible by the masternode
   network
-  Decentralized Governance By Blockchain allows masternode owners to
   vote on budget proposals and decisions that affect Dash. Budget
   proposals fund Dash development and come directly from block rewards,
   i.e. Dash development is self-funded by its own blockchain.



Emission Rate
==================

Cryptocurrencies such as Dash and Bitcoin are created through a
cryptographically difficult process known as mining. Mining involves
repeatedly solving `hash algorithms <x11>`__ until a valid
solution for the current `mining
difficulty <Dark-Gravity-Wave_1146926.html>`__ is discovered. Once
discovered, the miner is permitted to create new units of the currency.
This is known as the block reward. To ensure that the currency is not
subject to endless inflation, the block reward is reduced at regular
intervals. Graphing this data results in a curve showing total coins in
circulation, known as the coin emission rate. 

While Dash is based on Bitcoin, it significantly modifies the coin
emission rate to offer a smoother reduction in coin emission over time.
While Bitcoin reduces the coin emission rate by 50% every 4 years, Dash
reduces the emission by one-fourteenth (approx. 7.14%) every 210240
blocks (approx. 383.25 days). It can be seen that reducing the block
reward by a smaller amount each year offers a smoother transition to a
fee-based economy than Bitcoin.
