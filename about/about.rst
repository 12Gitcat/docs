About Dash
==================

Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused
cryptocurrency in the world. The Dash network features :ref:`instant
transaction confirmation <instantsend>`, double spend protection, 
anonymity equal to that of physical cash, a self-governing,
:ref:`self-funding model <budget-system>` driven by 
`incentivized full nodes <masternode-network>` and a `clear roadmap 
<https://github.com/dashpay/dash-roadmap>` for on-chain scaling to 
up to 400MB blocks using custom-developed open source hardware. 
While Dash is based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key
components of the Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-tier network structure
offers significant improvements in transaction speed, anonymity and
governance. This section of the documentation describes these and many
more key features that set Dash apart in the blockchain economy. For
full details, please read the `Dash whitepaper 
<https://github.com/dashpay/dash/wiki/Whitepaper>`__.
