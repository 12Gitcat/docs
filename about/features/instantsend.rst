InstantSend
==================

Dash is the first cryptocurrency to feature a concept called InstantSendÂ 
(transaction locking and masternode consensus). This technology will 
allow cryptocurrencies to compete with nearly instantaneous transaction 
systems such as credit cards for point-of-sale situations while not 
relying on a centralized authority. Widespread vendor acceptance of Dash 
and InstantSend could revolutionize cryptocurrency by shortening the 
delay in confirmation of transactions from as long as an hour (with 
Bitcoin) to as little as a few seconds.

InstantSend is described in full detail in a whitepaper titled 
`Transaction Locking and masternode Consensus: A Mechanism for 
Mitigating Double Spending Attacks
