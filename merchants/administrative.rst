Administrative Processes
========================

It's easy to get started integrating Dash, but you will need to make
some decisions about whether you plan to convert your income earned in
Dash into your local fiat currency, or if you prefer to hold some or all
of it in Dash. Most payment processors offer a range of fiat conversion
options, although various fees and limits may be applicable.

Onboarding Process
==================

New merchants typically go through the following steps when joining the
Dash ecosystem:

#. Set up a Dash wallet
#. Identify an appropriate payment processor
#. Decide on how and when to convert funds
#. Implementation and testing
#. Release and marketing
#. Integration on `DiscoverDash <https://discoverdash.com>`_

Legal considerations
====================

Tax, legal and regulatory considerations may be applicable in some
jurisdictions.
