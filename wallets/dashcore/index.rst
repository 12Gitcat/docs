This documentation describes the Dash Core Wallet and how to use its
basic functions. Since the functionality is similar across all supported
platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), the instructions and screenshots will
reference the Windows software, highlighting differences between the
platforms where necessary. See here for separate installation guides 
specific to each platform.

The Dash Core Wallet (sometimes known as the QT wallet, due to the QT
software framework used in development) is a professional or heavy wallet 
which downloads the full blockchain (several GB in size), operates as a 
full node on the network and offers all functions available to Dash. When 
the wallet starts up, some time is required for it to synchronise its 
copy of the blockchain with the network. Once this is done, the correct 
balances will be displayed and the functions in the wallet can be used.

Features:

-  PrivateSend
-  InstandSend
-  Wallet encryption
-  Coin control and fee control
-  QR code generation and address book
-  Masternode commands and voting
-  Automated backup
-  Debug console
