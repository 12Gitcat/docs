How to use the Dash Android Wallet
==================================

If you already have an existing Dash Wallet for Android, you can restore
it at this point by tapping the menu button in the top left corner and
selecting Safety > Restore from recovery phrase. Carefully enter your
recovery phrase and tap Restore. Your wallet may restart, and it will
take some time for any past transactions and balances to appear.
