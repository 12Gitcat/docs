Introduction
============

Text message (SMS) wallets allow you to easily transact in Dash using
a simple feature phone. An internet connection is not required. Because
text wallets require access to text messages, they generally only
support specific regions. See below for details.

CoinText is a for-purpose project to make cryptocurrency easy to use to
expand economic freedom around the world. It makes it possible to
transact in Dash without internet, apps, accounts or complicated
addresses. CoinText currently supports Dash transactions in the USA and
Canada and aims to expand to over 50 countries in coming months. It is
possible to denominate the amount to be sent in both Dash and the local
currency, and send Dash to both phone numbers and Dash addresses.
