How To Buy
==================

Dash can be purchased and sold in several ways, each with different
advantages and disadvantages. The following options are available:

- Exchanges_ are one of the most popular ways to trade cryptocurrency. A
  wide range of exchanges exist, each offering slightly different
  features. Some serve different markets, some are in direct
  competition, some have cheaper fees, and some are subject to more or
  less strict regulatory requirements. Most exchanges are centralized,
  meaning they are operated by a single company, which may be obliged by
  the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates to collect data on
  its customers. Others are decentralized, but as a result have higher
  escrow requirements since you are dealing peer-to- peer instead of
  with a trusted entity. Exchanges can be broadly broken down into two
  categories: exchanges which accept national currency (fiat money) and
  exchanges which deal in cryptocurrencies only.

- `Instant exchanges <instant_exchanges>`_ perform a similar
  function to normal exchanges, but without the requirement to log in.
  They effectively convert one currency to another, with some limits on
  the amount to be exchanged and usually at a less advantageous rate.
  Others may even offer to sell cryptocurrency as a credit card
  purchase.

  `Peer-to-peer exchanges <peer_to_peer>`_ have recently appeared to
  facilitate trading ofDash directly between individuals. Volume is
  often lower, and users typically make offers or requests at the price
  they are willing to pay, and wait for someone to contact them and
  arrange details of the sale. More advanced peer-to- peer sites offer
  escrow services for a fee to prevent cheating during the sale between
  two parties who have never met.

- ATMs_ accepting card and cash payments in return for crypto are widely
  available. Mapping services can show the specific location of these
  machines, or you can even set one up at your own business and earn a
  percentage of sales.
