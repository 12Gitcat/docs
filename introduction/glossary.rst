|                                   | one’s mobile device. This would   |
|                                   | be the equivalent of being able   |
|                                   | to backup the cash in your        |
|                                   | wallet, so that if you lost it,   |
|                                   | you could restore the cash from a |

| **Budget System / DGBB**          | The development of Dash and the   |
|                                   | Dash ecosystem is self-funded by  |
|                                   | the network. Each time a block is |
|                                   | discovered, 45% of the block      |
|                                   | reward goes to miners and 45%     |
|                                   | goes to masternodes. Ten percent  |
|                                   | is withheld by the network and    |
|                                   | used to fund projects that are    |

| **Confirm(ed) Transaction**       | When a Dash transaction is made,  |
|                                   | a miner must verify that the      |
|                                   | transaction is valid. When        |
|                                   | the inputs and outputs are        |
|                                   | verified, the transaction is      |
|                                   | included in a block in            |
|                                   | the blockchain. The transaction   |
|                                   | can then be considered complete   |
|                                   | and irreversible.                 |
|                                   | The confirmation number increases |
|                                   | as more blocks are added to the   |

| **Confirmation Number**           | The number of confirmations for a |
|                                   | specific Dash transaction. Zero   |
|                                   | confirmations means that the      |
|                                   | transaction is unconfirmed. One   |
|                                   | confirmation means that the       |
|                                   | transaction is included in the    |
|                                   | latest block in the blockchain.   |
|                                   | Two confirmations means the       |
|                                   | transaction is included in two    |
|                                   | blocks, three confirmations for   |
|                                   | three blocks, and so on. The      |
|                                   | probability of a transaction      |
|                                   | being reversed (double spent)     |
|                                   | diminishes exponentially with     |
|                                   | every block and subsequent        |
|                                   | confirmation. Six confirmations   |
|                                   | is usually considered "safe" and  |
|                                   | irreversable.                     |

| **Fork**                          | When the blockchain diverges or   |

|                                   | recognizing one version of the    |
|                                   | blockchain as valid, and other    |
|                                   | clients believing that a          |

|                                   | blockchain is valid. Most forks   |
|                                   | resolve themselves without        |
|                                   | causing any problems, because the |
|                                   | longest blockchain is always      |
|                                   | considered to be valid. In time,  |

|                                   | will usually "win" and become     |
|                                   | universally recognized as valid.  |
|                                   | Forks can, however, be extremely  |

| **Hash**                          | A mathematical process that takes |
|                                   | a variable amount of data and     |
|                                   | produces a shorter, fixed-length  |
|                                   | output. A hashing function has    |
|                                   | two important characteristics.    |
|                                   | First, it is mathematically       |
|                                   | difficult to work out what the    |
|                                   | original input was by looking at  |
|                                   | the output. Second, changing even |
|                                   | the tiniest part of the input     |
|                                   | will produce an entirely          |
|                                   | different output.                 |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Hashrate**                      | The number of hashes that can be  |

|                                   | given period of time (usually a   |

| **Pump and Dump**                 | Inflating the value of a          |
|                                   | financial asset that has been     |
|                                   | produced or acquired cheaply,     |
|                                   | often using aggressive publicity  |
|                                   | and misleading statements. The    |
|                                   | publicity causes others to        |
|                                   | acquire the asset, forcing up its |
|                                   | value. When the value is high     |
|                                   | enough, the perpetrator sells     |
|                                   | their assets, cashing in and      |
|                                   | flooding the market, which causes |
|                                   | the value to crash. This is       |
|                                   | particularly common in markets    |
|                                   | with low liquidity, such as some  |

| **vin**                           | A transaction (tx) consists of    |
|                                   | one or more inputs and one or     |
|                                   | more outputs. The vin is the list |
|                                   | of inputs to the transaction, and |
|                                   | vout is the list of outputs.      |
