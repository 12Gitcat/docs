51% Attack
  A condition in which more than half the computing power on a
  cryptocurrency network is controlled by a single miner or group of
  miners. That amount of power theoretically makes them the authority on
  the network. This means that every client on the network believes the
  attacker’s hashed transaction block.

Address
  A Dash address is used to Send / Receive a Payment on the Dash
  network. It contains a string of alphanumeric characters, but can also
  be represented as a scannable QR code. A Dash address is also the
  public key in the pair of keys used by Dash holders to digitally sign
  transactions (see Public key).

Algorithm
  In mathematics and computer science, an `algorithm 
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm>`_ is a self-contained 
  step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform 
  calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.

Altcoin
  Since Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and has the largest market
  capitalization, it is considered as the reference. An altcoin, or
  alternative coin, is any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin.

AML
  Anti-Money Laundering techniques are used to stop people from making
  illegally obtained funds appear as though they have been earned
  legally. AML mechanisms can be legal or technical in nature.
  Regulators frequently apply AML techniques to Dash exchanges.

API
  In computer programming, an `application programming interface (API) 
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface>`_ is
  a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software and
  applications.

  An API expresses a software component in terms of its operations,
  inputs, outputs, and underlying types, defining functionalities that
  are independent of their respective implementations, which allows
  definitions and implementations to vary without compromising the
  interface. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by
  providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the
  programmer.

ASIC
  An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), is an integrated
  circuit (IC) customized for a particular use, rather than intended for
  general-purpose use. For example, a chip designed to run in a digital
  voice recorder or for high-efficiency Dash mining is an ASIC.

ATM / BTM
  A Dash ATM is a physical machine that allows a customer to buy Dash
  with cash. There are many manufacturers, some of which enable users to
  sell Dash for cash. They are also sometimes called 'BTMs' or 'Dash
  AVMS.' Dash is supported on several `ATMs <how_to_buy>`_.

Backlog
  Backlog generally refers to an accumulation over time of work waiting
  to be done or orders to be fulfilled.

Backup
  The process of making copies of a computer file to ensure its
  integrity in case of loss, theft, or damage. Dash has the unique
  feature of allowing users to make backup copies of their digital
  wallets. This protects against losing one's money in the event of a
  computer crashing or losing one’s mobile device. This would be the
  equivalent of being able to backup the cash in your wallet, so that if
  you lost it, you could restore the cash from a backup.

Bitcoin 2.0
  This is a term explaining the next new level of Bitcoin projects which
  started as a fork of Bitcoin but extended their code into the next
  level of Blockchain Projects (Smart Contracts, Decentralised
  Voting,....)

Blockchain
  A `blockchain <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)>`_ 
  is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list 
  of data records hardened against tampering and revision. It consists 
  of data structure blocks — which exclusively hold data in initial 
  blockchain implementations, and both data and programs in some of the 
  more recent implementations — with each block holding batches of 
  individual transactions and the results of any blockchain executables. 
  Each block contains a timestamp and information linking it to a 
  previous block.

Blocks  
  Transactions on the Blockchain are collected in "`blocks 
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)#Blocks>`_" which 
  record and confirm when and in what sequence transactions enter and 
  are logged in the block chain. Blocks are created by users known as
  "miners" who use specialized software or equipment designed
  specifically to create blocks.

Budget System / DGBB
  The development of Dash and the Dash ecosystem is self-funded by the
  network. Each time a block is discovered, 45% of the block reward goes
  to miners and 45% goes to masternodes. Ten percent is withheld by the
  network and used to fund projects that are approved by the masternode
  network. This process is known as Decentralized Governance by
  Blockchain (DGBB). For a fee, anybody can submit a proposal to the
  network, and will be paid directly by the blockchain if approved by
  the masternodes. The Budget System is sometimes called the Treasury
  System; the two terms are interchangeable.

  See here for more details on the budget system.

Cloud Wallet
  Third parties that will store your Dash on their servers for you, so
  that you can access your funds from any device connected to the
  internet. If their website is hacked or if their servers are damaged,
  you run the risk of losing your Dash. Any online wallets should be
  secured with strong passphrases and 2FA. You cannot make backup copies
  of your online wallet, because you do not have access to the private
  keys. We do not recommend that you store large quantities of funds in
  online wallets.

Cold Storage
  A method of generating and storing private keys completely offline.
  One could use a desktop or laptop computer disconnected from the
  internet, a dedicated hardware wallet, a USB stick, or a paper wallet.
  To learn more, visit our Cold Storage Guide Section.

Confirm(ed) Transaction
  When a Dash transaction is made, a miner must verify that the
  transaction is valid. When the inputs and outputs are verified, the
  transaction is included in a block in the blockchain. The transaction
  can then be considered complete and irreversible. The confirmation
  number increases as more blocks are added to the blockchain.

Confirmation Number
  The number of confirmations for a specific Dash transaction. Zero
  confirmations means that the **transaction is unconfirmed**. One
  confirmation means that the transaction is included in the latest
  block in the blockchain. Two confirmations means the transaction is
  included in two blocks, three confirmations for three blocks, and so
  on. The probability of a transaction being reversed (double spent)
  diminishes exponentially with every block and subsequent confirmation.
  Six confirmations is usually considered "safe" and irreversable.

Confirmed Transactions
  Transactions that are processed by miners and considered irreversible,
  usually after six confirmations. In the case of InstantSend, funds can
  be considered irreversible after a few seconds, but must still be
  written to the blockchain (and thus "confirmed").

CPU
  A `central processing unit (CPU) 
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit>`_ is the 
  electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the 
  instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, 
  logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the 
  instructions. The term has been used in the computer industry at least 
  since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a 
  processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit 
  (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external 
  components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.

Cryptocurrency
  A `cryptocurrency <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency>`_ (or 
  crypto currency or crypto-currency) is a medium of exchange using 
  cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of 
  new units.

Cryptography
  Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek κρυπτός *kryptós*, "hidden,
  secret"; and γράφειν *graphein*, "writing," or -λογία *-logia*,
  "study," respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for
  secure communication in the presence of third parties called
  adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and
  analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from
  reading private messages; various aspects in information security such
  as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-
  repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography
  exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer
  science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography
  include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.

Dark Gravity Wave
  In concept, :ref:`Dark Gravity Wave (DGW) <dark_gravity_wave>` is 
  similar to *Kimoto Gravity Well*, adjusting the difficulty levels 
  every block (instead of every 2016 blocks like Bitcoin) by using 
  statistical data of the last blocks found. In this way block issuing 
  times can remain consistent despite fluctuations in hashpower. However 
  it doesn't suffer from the time-warp exploit.

Darkcoin
  Dash was initially launched as XCoin and then rebranded to Darkcoin and
  finally Dash.

Dash
  Originally launched as Xcoin and later renamed to Darkcoin, the
  currency was later renamed "Dash" to avoid association with the
  darknet markets. Dash is a portmanteau of "Digital Cash." Dash is an
  open source peer-to- peer cryptocurrency that solves many of Bitcoin's
  problems. Dash's features include PrivateSend, InstantSend,
  Decentralized Governance by Blockchain (DGBB), a 2nd tier network
  (referred to as the masternode network). See the :ref:`Features
  <features>` page for a full list of Dash's features.

  `Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash_(cryptocurrency)>`_

Dash Client 
  Dash clients are software programs used to interface with the Dash
  network. They store the private keys needed to conduct Dash
  transactions as well as a copy of the entire blockchain. A Dash client
  connects to the Dash network and becomes a node in the network. A node
  shares and propagates new transactions with the rest of the network,
  creating a robust decentralized infrastructure.

Dash Evolution
  This is a 3 tier network Dash developers are presently building. It
  will make Dash as easy to use as PayPal, while still remaining
  decentralized. See the :ref:`Evolution <evolution>` page for more 
  information.

DDoS
  A distributed denial of service attack uses large numbers of computers
  under an attacker’s control to drain the resources of a central
  target. They often send small amounts of network traffic across the
  Internet to tie up computing and bandwidth resources at the target,
  which prevents it from providing services to legitimate users. Dash
  exchanges have sometimes been hit with DDoS attacks.

Decentralized
  `Decentralized computing 
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing>`_ is the 
  allocation of resources, both hardware and software, to each 
  individual workstation or office location. In contrast, centralized 
  computing exists when the majority of functions are carried out or 
  obtained from a remote centralized location. Decentralized computing 
  is a trend in modern-day business environments. This is the opposite 
  of centralized computing, which was prevalent during the early days of 
  computers. A decentralized computer system has many benefits over a 
  conventional centralized network. Desktop computers have advanced so 
  rapidly that their potential performance far exceeds the requirements 
  of most business applications. This results in most desktop computers 
  remaining nearly idle most of the time. A decentralized system can use 
  the potential of these systems to maximize efficiency. However, it is 
  debatable whether these networks increase overall effectiveness.

Desktop Wallet  
  A wallet is a piece of software that stores your Dash. There are many
  different wallet options, but it is imperative to choose a secure one.
  We recommend any of the following: :ref:`Dash Core Wallet
  <dash_core_wallet>` / :ref:`Dash Electrum Wallet
  <dash_electrum_wallet>` / :ref:`Hardware Wallets <hardware_wallets>`


Difficulty
  This number determines how difficult it is to hash a new block. It is
  related to the maximum allowed number in a given numerical portion of
  a transaction block’s hash. The lower the number, the more difficult
  it is to produce a hash value that fits it. Difficulty varies based on
  the amount of computing power used by miners on the Dash network. If
  large numbers of miners leave a network, the difficulty would
  decrease. Dash's increasing popularity and the availability of
  specialized ASIC miners have caused the difficulty to increase over
  time.

Digital Wallet
  See :ref:`this link <wallets>` for full documentation on wallets.

  A digital wallet is similar to a physical wallet except that it is
  used to hold **digital currency**. A Dash wallet holds your private
  keys, which allow you to spend your Dash. You are also able to make
  backups of your wallet in order to ensure that you never lose access
  to your Dash. Digital wallets can exist in many different forms and on
  many devices:

  - **Desktop Wallet** (:ref:`Dash Electrum Wallet
    <dash_electrum_wallet>`, :ref:`Dash Core Wallet 
    <dash_core_wallet>`): Wallet programs that you install on a laptop 
    or desktop computer. You are solely responsible for protecting the 
    wallet file and the private keys it contains. Make backup copies of 
    your wallet files to ensure that you don't lose access to your 
    funds.

  - **Mobile Wallet** (:ref:`Android <dash_android_wallet>`, :ref:`iOS
    <dash_ios_wallet>`): These wallets can be downloaded through Google
    Play or Apple (iTunes) App Stores. Mobile wallets allow you to use
    Dash on-the-go by scanning a QR code to send payment. Make backup
    copies of your mobile wallet files to ensure that you don't lose
    access to your funds. Due to security issues with mobile phones, it
    is advised that you don't store large amounts of funds on these
    wallets.

  - **Online/Cloud/Web Wallet** (:ref:`Exodus <third_party_wallets>`,
    :ref:`MyDashWallet <web_wallets>`): Third parties that will store 
    your Dash on their servers for you or provide an interface to access 
    your Dash with you providing the keys, so that you can access your 
    Dash from any device connected to the internet. If their website is 
    hacked or if their servers are damaged, you run the risk of losing 
    your Dash. Any online wallets should be secured with strong 
    passphrases and 2FA. You cannot make backup copies of your online 
    wallet, because you do not have access to the private keys. We 
    strongly urge that you NEVER store large amounts of Dash in any 
    online wallet or cryptocurrency exchange.

  - **Hardware Wallets** (:ref:`Trezor <hardware_wallets>`, KeepKey, 
    Ledger, Nano): A hardware wallet is a specialized, tamper-proof, 
    hardware device that stores your private keys. This device is able 
    to sign transactions with your private key without being connected 
    to the internet. However, you must have an internet connection to 
    send the transaction to the Dash network. This allows your private 
    keys to be accessed easily while still keeping them securely 
    protected. This is widely regarded to be the safest form of storage 
    for your Dash.

  - **Offline/Cold Storage** (:ref:`Paper wallet <paper_wallets>`): A
    special wallet that is created offline and is never exposed to the
    internet. Accomplished by using software to generate a public and
    private key offline and then recording the generated keys. They keys 
    can be printed out on paper or even laser-etched in metal. Copies 
    can be made and stored in a personal safe or bank deposit box. This 
    is an extremely secure way to store Dash. There is no risk of using 
    software wallet files, which can become corrupt, or web wallets, 
    which can be hacked. NOTE: USB sticks are not safe for long-term 
    (multi-year) storage because they degrade over time.

Digital Signature
  A digital signature is a mathematical mechanism that allows someone to
  prove their identity or ownership of a digital asset. When your
  digital wallet signs a transaction with the appropriate private key,
  the whole network can see that the signature matches the address of
  the Dash being spent, without the need to reveal the private key to
  the network. You can also digitally sign messages using your private
  key, to prove for instance that you are the owner of a certain Dash
  address.

Electrum Wallet
  :ref:`Dash Electrum Wallet <dash_electrum_wallet>` is a lightweight
  wallet that does not require you to download or sync the entire
  blockchain, making the wallet lighter and faster. However, it is 
  missing certain features such as PrivateSend and InstantSend.

Encryption
  In cryptography, `encryption 
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption>`_ is the process of 
  encoding messages or information in such a way that only authorized 
  parties can read it. Encrypted messages which are intercepted by a 
  third-party are indecipherable gibberish without the private key. In 
  an encryption scheme, the *plaintext* message is encrypted using an 
  encryption algorithm, generating *ciphertext* that can only be read if 
  decrypted by the intended recipient. For technical reasons, an 
  encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key 
  generated by an algorithm. Increases in computing power have "broken" 
  many past encryption algorithms, but a well-designed modern system 
  such as AES-256 is considered essentially "uncrackable."

Escrow Services
  An `escrow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow>`_ is:

  - a contractual arrangement in which a third party receives and
    disburses money or documents for the primary transacting parties,
    with the disbursement dependent on conditions agreed to by the
    transacting parties; or 

  - an account established by a broker for holding funds on behalf of
    the broker's principal or some other person until the consummation
    or termination of a transaction; or

  - a trust account held in the borrower's name to pay obligations such
    as property taxes and insurance premiums.

  A trusted escrow service is often used when purchasing cryptocurrency
  or other goods/services over the internet. Both the buyer and seller
  will choose a trusted third-party, the seller will send the item (or
  currency) to the escrow agent, and the buyer will send the purchasing
  funds to the escrow agent as well. Once the escrow agent is satisfied
  that both parties have satisfied the terms of the agreement, he/she
  will forward the funds and the product (or currency) being purchased
  to the appropriate party.

Evan Duffield
  Founder and first Lead Developer of Dash. Inventor of X11, InstantSend
  and PrivateSend. Before creating Dash, Evan was a financial advisor
  and holds a Series 65 license.

Exchange
  The current price of one Dash compared to the price of other
  currencies, like the US dollar, Yen, Euro, or Bitcoin. Because most
  trading volume takes place on the BTC/DASH markets, price is often
  quoted in fractions of a bitcoin. For instance, the price of one Dash
  at the end of March 2017 was 0.08 (bitcoins per Dash). An excellent
  site for following the exchange rate of Dash is `CoinMarketCap
  <https://coinmarketcap.com/>`_. Businesses wishing to reduce the risk
  of holding a volatile digital currency can avoid that risk altogether
  by having a payment processor do an instant exchange at the time of
  each transaction.

Faucet
  Faucets are a reward system, in the form of a website or app, that
  dispenses rewards in the form of a microdash or Duff, which is a
  hundredth of a millionth Dash, for visitors to claim in exchange for
  completing a captcha or task as described by the website.

Fiat Gateway
  `Fiat money <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money>`_ has been 
  defined variously as:

  - Any money declared by a government to be legal tender.
  - State-issued money which is neither convertible by law to any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.
  - Intrinsically valueless money used as money because of government decree.
  
  Examples include the US dollar, the Euro, the Yen, and so forth.

Fintech
  `Financial technology
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology>`_, also known as
  FinTech, is an economic industry composed of companies that use
  technology to make financial services more efficient. Financial
  technology companies are generally startups trying to make financial
  processes more efficient or eliminate middle- men. Recently many
  fintech companies have begun utilizing blockchain technology, which is
  the same technology that underpins Dash and Bitcoin.

Fork
  When the blockchain diverges or splits, with some clients recognizing
  one version of the blockchain as valid, and other clients believing
  that a different version of the blockchain is valid. Most forks
  resolve themselves without causing any problems, because the longest
  blockchain is always considered to be valid. In time, one version of
  the blockchain will usually "win" and become universally recognized as
  valid. Forks can, however, be extremely dangerous and should be
  avoided if possible.

  Forking is most likely to occur during software updates to the
  network. Dash uses a Multi-Phased Fork (“:ref:`Spork <sporks>`”)
  system for greater flexibility and safety.
