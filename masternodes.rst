Dash is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with a strong focus
on the payments industry. Dash offers a form of money that is portable,
inexpensive, divisible and fast. It can be spent securely both online
and in person with only minimal transaction fees. Based on the Bitcoin
project, Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments
system in the world. In addition to Bitcoin's feature set, Dash 
currently also offers instant transactions (:ref:`instantsend`), private 
transactions (:ref:`privatesend`) and operates a self-governing and 
self-funding model that enables the Dash network to pay individuals 
and businesses for work that adds value to the network. This 
decentralized governance and budgeting system makes it one of the first 
ever successful decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).
