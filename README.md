# Dash Documentation

The official Dash documentation serves to describe all aspects of the Dash ecosystem, ranging from information for new users through to guides on more difficult tasks such as compiling Dash Core from source. Developer documentation is available separately at https://dash-docs.github.io/

The documentation is written in reStructuredText and is designed to be built with Sphinx and hosted by Read the Docs. Contributions to the English source text are welcome in this repository, while translations are managed using Transifex at https://www.transifex.com/dash/dash-docs
