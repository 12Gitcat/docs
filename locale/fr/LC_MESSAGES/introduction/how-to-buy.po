"Exchanges_ are one of the most popular ways to trade cryptocurrency. A wide "
"range of exchanges exist, each offering slightly different features. Some "
"serve different markets, some are in direct competition, some have cheaper "
"fees, and some are subject to more or less strict regulatory requirements. "
"Most exchanges are centralized, meaning they are operated by a single "
"company, which may be obliged by the laws of the jurisdiction in which it "
"operates to collect data on its customers. Others are decentralized, but as "
"a result have higher escrow requirements since you are dealing peer-to-peer "
"instead of with a trusted entity. Exchanges can be broadly broken down into "
"two categories: exchanges which accept national currency (fiat money) and "
"exchanges which deal in cryptocurrencies only. For safety, exchanges should "
"not be used as wallets. Exchanges are for trading, not for savings."

"`Instant exchanges`_ perform a similar function to normal exchanges, but "
"without the requirement to log in. They effectively convert one currency to "
"another, with some limits on the amount to be exchanged and usually at a "
"less advantageous rate. Others may even offer to sell cryptocurrency as a "
"credit card purchase."

"`Over the counter`_ exchanges have recently appeared to facilitate sale of "
"Dash directly from a company to the individual at a specified price, or "
"peer-to-peer between individuals at a negotiated price. Volume may be "
"limited compared to exchanges, but these services are usually much easier to"
" use. More advanced peer-to- peer sites offer escrow services for a fee to "
"prevent cheating during the sale between two parties who have never met."

"ATMs_ accepting card and cash payments in return for crypto are widely "
"available. Mapping services can show the specific location of these "

"Cryptocurrency exchanges exist to convert national currency, also known as "

"their ticker codes. Dash is widely accepted on exchanges and many pairs "
"exist against both fiat money and cryptocurrency. This means it is possible "
