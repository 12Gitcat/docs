"When you first start your Dash Wallet, it will automatically generate a new "
"wallet for you. The first thing you should do is back up this wallet by "
"tapping the menu button in the top left corner and selecting **Safety** > "
"**View recovery phrase**. You will need this phrase to recover the funds "
"later if you lose or damage your phone or need to transfer the account to "
"another device. Write the phrase down and store it in a safe place - if you "
"lose this, you will also lose access to your funds forever. If you prefer, "
"you can also back up a password protected wallet file by selecting "
"**Safety** > **Back up wallet**."
