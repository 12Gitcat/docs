"While Dash offers stable binary builds on the `website "
"<https://www.dash.org/downloads>`_ and on `GitHub "
"<https://github.com/dashpay/dash/releases>`_, and development builds using "
"`Jenkins <https://jenkins.dash.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/dashpay-dash-"
"gitian-nightly/activity/>`_, many users will also be interested in building "
"Dash binaries for themselves. This process has been greatly simplified with "
"the release of Dash Core 0.13.0, and users who do not required deterministic"
" builds can typically follow the `generic build notes "
"<https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/develop/doc/build-generic.md>`__ "
"available on GitHub to compile or cross-compile Dash for any platform."

"Dash 提供稳定二进制版本在 `website <https://www.dash.org/downloads>`_ 和 `GitHub "
"<https://github.com/dashpay/dash/releases>`_， 还有开发利用 `Jenkins "
"<https://jenkins.dash.org/blue/organizations/jenkins/dashpay-dash-gitian-"
"nightly/activity/>`_， 很多用户对自己编译感兴趣。随着 Dash Core 0.13.0 在发布，这一过程被极大简化， 那些不需要 "
"deterministic 的用户可直接按照 `generic build notes "
"<https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/develop/doc/build-generic.md>`__ "
"来编译或者为其它平台跨编译。"

"Gitian is the deterministic build process that is used to build the Dash "
"Core executables. It provides a way to be reasonably sure that the "
"executables are really built from the source on GitHub. It also makes sure "
"that the same, tested dependencies are used and statically built into the "
"executable. Multiple developers build the source code by following a "
"specific descriptor (\"recipe\"), cryptographically sign the result, and "
"upload the resulting signature. These results are compared and only if they "
"match, the build is accepted and uploaded to dash.org."
msgstr ""
"Gitian属于确定性构建过程，用于构建Dash "
"Core的可执行文件。Gitian提供有一种方法，可合理地确认可执行文件真实构建自GitHub上的源文件。Gitian还可确保将相同的、经过测试的依赖项应用于可执行文件，并将其静态构建到可执行文件中。多名开发者依照特定的描述符（\"recipe\"）来构建源代码，加密签署结果，并将生成的签名上传。对这些结果进行比较，如果相匹配，则接受构建并上传至dash.org。"
