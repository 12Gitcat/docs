"When you first start your Dash Wallet, you will be prompted to choose "
"between creating a new wallet or restoring an existing wallet from backup. "
"Choose **Get started** to create a new wallet unless you have existing funds"
" stored in another wallet using a recovery phrase. Your new wallet will be "
"generated, and a recovery phrase will appear so you can recover the funds "
"later if you lose or damage your device or need to transfer the account to "
"another device. Write the phrase down on paper and store it in a safe place "
"- if you lose this, you will also lose access to your funds forever. Do not "
"take screenshots to store your recovery phrase! Screenshots may be "
"automatically backed up to cloud file storage services where you may no "
"longer have complete control over who views the files."
