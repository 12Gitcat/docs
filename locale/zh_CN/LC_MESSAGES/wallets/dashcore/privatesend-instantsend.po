"This documentation describes how to use Dash Core to send Dash anonymously. "
"PrivateSend, released as DarkSend in RC4 of the DarkCoin client and "
"rebranded to PrivateSend in May 2016, is a trustless method of running a "
"sequence of transactions (known as \"mixing\") such that an external "
"observer is unable to determine the source of funding when a PrivateSend "
"transaction is created. This gives your Dash the same anonymous properties "
"as cash withdrawn from an ATM, for example. The mixing and denomination "
"process is seamless, automatic, and requires no intervention on the part of "
"the user. The current implementation of PrivateSend in the Dash Core wallet "
"allows any amount of Dash to be mixed for later use in PrivateSend "
"transactions. As of April 2018, PrivateSend is not currently available in "
"other Dash wallets."
msgstr ""
"本文档介绍了如何使用达世币核心钱包来匿名发送达世币。匿名发送功能始创于Darkcoin "
"RC4客户端，最初被称作Darksend。随后，这个功能在2016年5月被重新命名为匿名发送。它无需信任第三方就能完成一系列的交易操作（这一环节通常也被称作混币）。混币期间，外部的服务器无法确定匿名发送功能所涉资金的来源。匿名发送功能赋予了用户在ATM取现一样的匿名属性。混币和面值的处理过程是自动完成、无缝对接的，以用户的角度来看，他们不会受到任何干扰。达世币核心钱包当前的匿名发送功能可以帮助用户混合任意金额的达世币，以便之后匿名发送的使用。截至2018年4月，匿名发送功能还没有推广到其它版本的达世币钱包。"
