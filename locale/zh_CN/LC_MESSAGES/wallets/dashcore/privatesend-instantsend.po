"This documentation describes how to use Dash Core to send Dash privately. "
"PrivateSend, released as DarkSend in RC4 of the DarkCoin client and "
"rebranded to PrivateSend in May 2016, is a trustless method of running a "
"sequence of transactions (known as \"mixing\") such that an external "
"observer is unable to determine the source of funding when a PrivateSend "
"transaction is created. This gives your Dash the same privacy properties as "
"cash withdrawn from an ATM, for example. The mixing and denomination process"
" is seamless, automatic, and requires no intervention on the part of the "
"user. The current implementation of PrivateSend in the Dash Core wallet "
"allows any amount of Dash to be mixed for later use in PrivateSend "
"transactions. PrivateSend is also available in the :ref:`Dash Electrum "
"<dash-electrum-wallet>` wallet."
