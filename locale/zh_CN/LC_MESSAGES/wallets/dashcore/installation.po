"These videos show how to download, verify the checksum and install the Dash "
"Core Wallet on Linux, macOS and Windows systems. While they are somewhat out"
" of date, the procedure is still largely the same. The main difference is "
"that the official Dash website is now https://www.dash.org/ rather than "
"https://www.dashpay.io/ as stated in the videos, although the old site will "
"redirect you to the new one. Also, in later versions of Dash Core, "
"application data such as the blockchain is now stored in the \"DashCore\" "
"rather than \"Dash\" folder."

"这一部分的视频讲述了如何在Linux、macOS和Windows系统里去下载，验证校验和以及安装达世币核心钱包。其内容可能有点过时，但流程大体差不多。主要的差别是达世币现在的官网是"
" https://www.dash.org 而不是视频里说的 https://www.dashpay.io/ "
"，当然旧官网也会将你重新指向新的官网。另外，在最新的达世币核心中，应用数据如区块链是存储在“达世核心”而不是“达世文件夹”下。"
