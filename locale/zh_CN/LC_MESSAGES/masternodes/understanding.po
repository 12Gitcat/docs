"Simply put, a masternode is a server with a full copy of the Dash "

"as PrivateSend and InstantSend, as the anonymity and instant transaction "

"using a concept known as Proof of Service. This is in addition to the Proof "

"Anyone can run a masternode. The objective is to have enough "

"unnecessary masternodes or encouraging reckless operators, there is one "
"condition that needs to be fulfilled: proof of ownership of 1000 Dash. The "
"coins don't need to be in the masternode, but they need to be kept in a "
"certain way that is transparent to the entire network. If the owner moves or"
" spends those coins, the masternode stops working and payment ceases."

"任何个人都可以运行达世币主节点。主节点的目标是提高去中心化程度，从而避免某个人或某一群体掌控大量的主节点。不过，为了防范不必要的主节点或莽撞的持有人，达世币网络要求个人存入1000个达世币用以证明资格，能够持有一个主节点。这笔资金不必绑定在主节点上，但是必须存在达世币网络上并向整个网络公开。一旦持有人将资金提现或支出，主节点将停止运行而关联的区块奖励也将停止支付。"

"Masternodes are paid by the network for the PrivateSend, InstantSend and "

" masternodes, 45% to miners and 10% to the budget. In practice, half of the "
"reward from a normal block goes to the miner and half to the masternode. "
"Then, every 16,616 blocks (approximately 30.29 days), a superblock is "
"created that contains the entire 10% payout to the budget proposal winners. "
"Masternodes are randomly selected for payment in each block (approximately "
"every 2.6 minutes) from a list once they reach the top 10% of the total "

"more masternodes are created, the duration between payments increases. Due "

" similar payments. If the collateral behind a masternode is spent, or if a "

"主节点为匿名发送功能、即时发送功能和各项管理服务提供支持，应以此获得区块奖励。达世币的区块奖励按以下方式分配：45%划拨给主节点持有人，45%分配给矿工，而剩下的10%则作为预算资金。在实际操作中，矿工和主节点持有人分别获得区块奖励的一半。每隔16616个区块（约30.29天），达世币网络上将诞生一个超级块，此时，10%的区块奖励将会被分配给获得投票批准的提案。各个区块上的主节点将被随机选作支付方（时间间隔约为2.6分钟），并在支付后移动到列表的后面。随着已创建的主节点的数量的增加，支付之间的时间间隔也将增加。考虑到算法的选择，支付选择始终存在随机性，但从长远来看，所有主节点持有人都会收到类似的付款。如果主节点所关联的保证金已被支出或主节点停止向网络提供服务的时间超过一个小时，那么主节点将从列表中移除，直到主节点服务恢复正常。达世币通过这种方式激励主节点为网络提供有效和可靠的服务。"
