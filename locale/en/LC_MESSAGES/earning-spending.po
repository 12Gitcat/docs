"A range of services and businesses are available to convert your wage to "
"and from Dash as you receive it. It is of course easiest to receive "
"payment from your employer in Dash directly, however this may not always "
"be an option. Services such as `Dashlancer <http://dashlancer.com>`_ can "
"help you find freelance work paid in Dash. `Uphold <https://uphold.com>`_"
" allows you to instantly and automatically convert any received deposits "
"to and from Dash. Building on this functionality, `Bitwage "
"<https://www.bitwage.com>`_ allows you to invoice and receive payment "
"from any employer, practically anywhere in the world, and have a "
"percentage of your wage immediately converted to Dash. You can then "
"withdraw your wage to any Dash wallet for spending or saving. For more "
"information, see the following blog posts:"
