"These videos show how to download, verify the checksum and install the "
"Dash Core Wallet on Linux, macOS and Windows systems. While they are "
"somewhat out of date, the procedure is still largely the same. The main "
"difference is that the official Dash website is now https://www.dash.org/"
" rather than https://www.dashpay.io/ as stated in the videos, although "
"the old site will redirect you to the new one. Also, in later versions of"
" Dash Core, application data such as the blockchain is now stored in the "
"\"DashCore\" rather than \"Dash\" folder."
