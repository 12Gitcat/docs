"Decentralized Governance by Blockchain, or DGBB, is Dash's attempt to solve "
"two important problems in cryptocurrency: governance and funding. Governance"
" in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition there are no"
" central authorities to make decisions for the project. In Dash, such "
"decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of masternodes. "
"The DGBB system allows each masternode to vote once (yes/no/abstain) for "
"each proposal. If a proposal passes, it can then be implemented (or not) by "
"Dash's developers. A key example is early in 2016, when Dash's Core Team "
"submitted a proposal to the network asking whether the blocksize should be "
"increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours, consensus had been reached to approve "
"this change. Compare this to Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been"
" raging for nearly three years."

"La gobernanza descentralizada por cadena de bloques en ingles: "
"(Decentralized Governance by Blockchain DGBB) es un intento de Dash que "
"tiene como objetivo de resolver los problemas de manejo en proyectos "
"descentralizados como el desarrollo de Dash. Debido a que no hay autoridades"
" centrales que decidan enrumbar o tomar las decisiones del proyecto. Las "
"decisiones son tomadas por la red, específicamente la red de master-nodos. "
"El sistema DGBB permite a cada master-nodo votar (si/no/abstengo) para cada "
"propuesta. Si la propuesta pasa, puede ser implementada (o no) por los "
"desarrolladores de Dash. Un ejemplo clave es: cuando en el 2016, el equipo "
"núcleo de Dash envió una propuesta a la red preguntando si el tamaño del "
"bloque debería ser incrementado a 2MB. Dentro de las primeras 24 horas se "
"alcanzaron los votos para aprobar este cambio. Comparando con Bitcoin donde "
"el debate del tamaño del bloque está sucediendo desde hace 3 años."

"DGBB also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While other"
" projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, Dash uses 10% "
"of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time a block is "
"mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a masternode, and "
"the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the month. During the "
"month, anybody can make a budget proposal to the network. If that proposal "
"receives net approval of at least 10% of the masternode network, then at the"
" end of the month a series of \"superblocks\" will be created. At that time,"
" the block rewards that were not paid out (10% of each block) will be used "
"to fund approved proposals. The network thus funds itself by reserving 10% "
"of the block reward for budget projects."

"there are many Object types from Users to Accounts to Contacts etc, and if "
"we didn't make this change first, future changes / improvements in Evolution"
" (e.g. adding a new type of Object) would require changing core code. Now "
"Core is agnostic to types of objects and we can take this forward for user "
"experience and not just governance. In terms of documentation, there is no "
"whitepaper specific to Sentinel, but we have various docs for Evo in an on-"

"Transactions on the Dash network are recorded in blocks on the blockchain. "
"The size of each transaction is measured in bytes, but there is not "
"necessarily a correlation between high value transactions and the number of "
"bytes required to process the transaction. Instead, transaction size is "
"affected by how many input and output addresses are involved, since more "
"data must be written in the block to store this information. Each new block "
"is generated by a miner, who is paid for completing the work to generate the"
" block with a block reward. In order to prevent the network from being "
"filled with spam transactions, the size of each block is artificially "
"limited. As transaction volume increases, the space in each block becomes a "
"scarce commodity. Because miners are not obliged to include any transaction "
"in the blocks they produce, once blocks are full, a voluntary transaction "
"fee can be included as an incentive to the miner to process the transaction."
" Most wallets include a small fee by default, although many miners will "
"process transactions even if no fee is included."
