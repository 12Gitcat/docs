"Dash is best known as the first cryptocurrency with a focus on anonymity and"
" transaction speed. What many people do not know is that these features are "
"implemented on top of a network of dedicated servers known as masternodes, "
"which gives rise to many exciting features not available on conventional "
"blockchains. These features include anonymous and instant transactions, as "
"well as governance of the development of the Dash network through a monthly "
"budget and voting. This in itself is a first in the crypto world, and the "
"masternodes are necessary to achieve the privacy and speed that Dash offers."
