"Whenever you are storing objects with a market value, security is necessary."
" This applies to barter systems as well as economies using currency as a "
"medium of exchange. While banks store balances on a private ledger, "
"cryptocurrencies store balances under unique addresses on a distributed "
"public ledger. The cryptographic private keys to access the balance stored "
"on each public address are therefore the object of value in this system. "
"This section of the documentation discusses different practical methods of "
"keeping these keys safe in wallets, while still remaining useful for day-to-"
"day needs."

"Dash Core Wallet is the full official release supporting all Dash features "
"as they are released, including InstantSend and PrivateSend, as well as the "
"governance, masternode and voting features. It is identical to the software "
"used by the Dash masternodes, and as such, it requires you to download the "
"entire Dash blockchain. It is available for macOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi and "
"Windows."

"The Dash Copay wallet is a modern and feature-rich wallet available for both"
" mobile and desktop devices. It supports advanced Dash features including "
"InstantSend, HD address generation, user-friendly address books, multiple "
"wallets in one app and easy to use multi-signature wallets. Dash Copay is a "
"light wallet, meaning that even though a full copy of the blockchain is not "
"required for use, the private keys to your addresses are stored securely on "
"your device and under your control at all times."

"Electrum-Dash is a light wallet which uses powerful external servers to "
"index the blockchain, while still securing the keys on your personal "
"computer. Transactions are verified on the Dash blockchain using a technique"
" called Secure Payment Verification (SPV), which only requires the block "
"headers and not the full block. This means that wallet startup is almost "
"instant, while still keeping your funds secure and mobile. It does not "
"currently support advanced InstantSend and PrivateSend features."

"Web wallets are services which keep a Dash balance for you, while "
"maintaining control of the private keys on your behalf. Any Dash stored on "
"exchanges falls under this category, but there are also some services "
"claiming to store Dash for you through simple Google/Facebook login systems."
" Be extremely careful with web storage, as your Dash is only as secure as "
"the reputation of the company storing it for you."
