"A range of services and businesses are available to convert your wage to and"
" from Dash as you receive it. It is of course easiest to receive payment "
"from your employer in Dash directly, however this may not always be an "
"option. Services such as `Dashlancer <http://dashlancer.com>`_ can help you "
"find freelance work paid in Dash. `Uphold <https://uphold.com>`_ allows you "
"to instantly and automatically convert any received deposits to and from "
"Dash. Building on this functionality, `Bitwage <https://www.bitwage.com>`_ "
"allows you to invoice and receive payment from any employer, practically "
"anywhere in the world, and have a percentage of your wage immediately "
"converted to Dash. You can then withdraw your wage to any Dash wallet for "
"spending or saving. For more information, see the following blog posts:"
