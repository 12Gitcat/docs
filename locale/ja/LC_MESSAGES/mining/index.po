"Mining in the context of cryptocurrency such as Dash refers to the process "
"of searching for solutions to cryptographically difficult problems as a "
"method of securing blocks on the blockchain. The process of mining creates "
"new currency tokens as a reward to the miner. Mining is possible on a range "
"of hardware. Dash implements an algorithm known as X11, which the miner must"
" solve in order to earn rewards."

"The simplest and most general hardware available for mining is the general "
"purpose CPU present in every computer. A CPU is designed to be versatile but"
" offers less efficiency than a GPU, which is designed to rapidly calculate "
"millions of vectors in parallel. While specific CPU instruction enhancements"
" related to cryptography such as AES or AVX can provide a decent boost, GPUs"
" offer a significant performance increase due to their multiple pipelines "
"for predictable calculations of the type involved with mining. Finally, "
"ASICs can perform a single operation only. A number of X11 ASICs are now "
"available on the market, which are quickly making CPU and GPU mining "
"uneconomic due to the increased difficulty of hashing arising from the "
"rapidly increasing hash rate. The result is a currency which is more secure "
"against brute force attacks on the Dash blockchain."
