"Exchanges_ are one of the most popular ways to trade cryptocurrency. A "
"wide range of exchanges exist, each offering slightly different features."
" Some serve different markets, some are in direct competition, some have "
"cheaper fees, and some are subject to more or less strict regulatory "
"requirements. Most exchanges are centralized, meaning they are operated "
"by a single company, which may be obliged by the laws of the jurisdiction"
" in which it operates to collect data on its customers. Others are "
"decentralized, but as a result have higher escrow requirements since you "
"are dealing peer-to-peer instead of with a trusted entity. Exchanges can "
"be broadly broken down into two categories: exchanges which accept "
"national currency (fiat money) and exchanges which deal in "
"cryptocurrencies only. For safety, exchanges should not be used as "
"wallets. Exchanges are for trading, not for savings."
msgstr ""

"`Instant exchanges`_ perform a similar function to normal exchanges, but "
"without the requirement to log in. They effectively convert one currency "
"to another, with some limits on the amount to be exchanged and usually at"
" a less advantageous rate. Others may even offer to sell cryptocurrency "
"as a credit card purchase."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Over the counter`_ exchanges have recently appeared to facilitate sale "
"of Dash directly from a company to the individual at a specified price, "
"or peer-to-peer between individuals at a negotiated price. Volume may be "
"limited compared to exchanges, but these services are usually much easier"
" to use. More advanced peer-to- peer sites offer escrow services for a "
"fee to prevent cheating during the sale between two parties who have "
"never met."

"ATMs_ accepting card and cash payments in return for crypto are widely "
"available. Mapping services can show the specific location of these "
"machines, or you can even set one up at your own business and earn a "

"Cryptocurrency exchanges exist to convert national currency, also known "

"handled on markets, and trades are created between pairs of currencies, "
"identified by their ticker codes. Dash is widely accepted on exchanges "
"and many pairs exist against both fiat money and cryptocurrency. This "
"means it is possible to exchange EUR for DASH, or DASH for BTC, for "
