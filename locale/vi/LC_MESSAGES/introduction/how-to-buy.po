":ref:`Exchanges <exchanges>` are one of the most popular ways to trade "
"cryptocurrency. A wide range of exchanges exist, each offering slightly "
"different features. Some serve different markets, some are in direct "
"competition, some have cheaper fees, and some are subject to more or less "
"strict regulatory requirements. Most exchanges are centralized, meaning they"
" are operated by a single company, which may be obliged by the laws of the "
"jurisdiction in which it operates to collect data on its customers. Others "
"are decentralized, but as a result have higher escrow requirements since you"
" are dealing peer-to-peer instead of with a trusted entity. Exchanges can be"
" broadly broken down into two categories: exchanges which accept national "
"currency (fiat money) and exchanges which deal in cryptocurrencies only. For"
" safety, exchanges should not be used as wallets. Exchanges are for trading,"
" not for savings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction/how-to-buy.rst:29
msgid ""
":ref:`Instant exchanges <instant_exchanges>` perform a similar function to "
"normal exchanges, but without the requirement to log in. They effectively "
"convert one currency to another, with some limits on the amount to be "
"exchanged and usually at a less advantageous rate. Others may even offer to "
"sell cryptocurrency as a credit card purchase."

msgid ""
":ref:`Over the counter <over-the-counter>` exchanges have recently appeared "
"to facilitate sale of Dash directly from a company to the individual at a "
"specified price, or peer-to-peer between individuals at a negotiated price. "
"Volume may be limited compared to exchanges, but these services are usually "
"much easier to use. More advanced peer-to-peer sites offer escrow services "
"for a fee to prevent cheating during the sale between two parties who have "
"never met."

"Cryptocurrency exchanges exist to convert national currency, also known as "
"fiat money, into cryptocurrency. Many exchanges do not accept fiat money, "
"and exchange between various cryptocurrencies only. Trades are handled on "
"markets, and trades are created between pairs of currencies, identified by "
"their ticker codes. Dash is widely accepted on exchanges and many pairs "
"exist against both fiat money and cryptocurrency. This means it is possible "
"to exchange EUR for DASH, or DASH for BTC, for example. The volume traded on"
