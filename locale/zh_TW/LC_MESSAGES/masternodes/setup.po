" It also requires regular maintenance and careful security, particularly if "

"A VPS, more commonly known as a cloud server, is fully functional "

"than having a single operating system running on the \"bare metal \" of each"
" server. A VPS is ideal for hosting a Dash masternode because they typically"
" offer guaranteed uptime, redundancy in the case of hardware failure and a "
"static IP address that is required to ensure you remain in the masternode "
"payment queue. While running a masternode from home on a desktop computer is"
