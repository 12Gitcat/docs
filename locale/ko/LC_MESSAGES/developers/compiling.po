"This guide describes how to build Dash Core wallet without the GUI from "
"source under Ubuntu Linux. It is intended to serve as a simple guide for "
"general compilation of non-deterministic binary files from the stable source"
" code. A standard installation of Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS will be used as an "
"environment for the build. We assume you are running as a user with sudo "
"permissions. First add the necessary extra repository and update all "

"Gitian is the deterministic build process that is used to build the Dash "
"Core executables. It provides a way to be reasonably sure that the "
"executables are really built from the source on GitHub. It also makes sure "
"that the same, tested dependencies are used and statically built into the "
"executable. Multiple developers build the source code by following a "
"specific descriptor (\"recipe\"), cryptographically sign the result, and "
"upload the resulting signature. These results are compared and only if they "
"match, the build is accepted and uploaded to dash.org."

"Gitian builds are known to be working on Debian 8.x. If your machine is "

"Debian 8.x image during the installation process and naming your non-root "
"user ``gitianuser``. Selecting a VPS with two processors will also greatly "
