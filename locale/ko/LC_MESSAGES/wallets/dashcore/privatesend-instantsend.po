"This documentation describes how to use Dash Core to send Dash "
"anonymously. PrivateSend, released as DarkSend in RC4 of the DarkCoin "
"client and rebranded to PrivateSend in May 2016, is a trustless method of"
" running a sequence of transactions (known as \"mixing\") such that an "
"external observer is unable to determine the source of funding when a "
"PrivateSend transaction is created. This gives your Dash the same "
"anonymous properties as cash withdrawn from an ATM, for example. The "
"mixing and denomination process is seamless, automatic, and requires no "
"intervention on the part of the user. The current implementation of "
"PrivateSend in the Dash Core wallet allows any amount of Dash to be mixed"
" for later use in PrivateSend transactions. As of April 2018, PrivateSend"
" is not currently available in other Dash wallets."

"InstantSend functions by setting a flag on the transaction, causing "
"deterministic selection of a quorum of 10 masternodes for each input "
"spent in an InstantSend transaction. The masternodes examine the input, "
"and if a majority determines it has at least six confirmations, they then"
" accept the transaction. The input is then locked until the transaction "
"has been confirmed in six mined blocks, at which point the output can be "
"used as an input in another InstantSend transaction. This differs from "
"inputs used in normal transactions, which can be spent after just one "
"confirmation regardless of whether the Dash was received using "
"InstantSend or not. A higher fee will be charged for InstantSend "
"transactions, according to the :ref:`fee schedule <fees>`. Note that the "
"receiving wallet must also be aware of InstantSend in order to be able to"
" immediately continue with the transaction or display an apporiate "
