":ref:`Exchanges <exchanges>` are one of the most popular ways to trade "
"cryptocurrency. A wide range of exchanges exist, each offering slightly "
"different features. Some serve different markets, some are in direct "
"competition, some have cheaper fees, and some are subject to more or less"
" strict regulatory requirements. Most exchanges are centralized, meaning "
"they are operated by a single company, which may be obliged by the laws "
"of the jurisdiction in which it operates to collect data on its "
"customers. Others are decentralized, but as a result have higher escrow "
"requirements since you are dealing peer-to-peer instead of with a trusted"
" entity. Exchanges can be broadly broken down into two categories: "
"exchanges which accept national currency (fiat money) and exchanges which"
" deal in cryptocurrencies only. For safety, exchanges should not be used "
"as wallets. Exchanges are for trading, not for savings."

"신뢰된 결사체를 통해 거래하는 것이 아니라 피어 투 피어 거래 방식으로 진행되므로 더욱 높은 수준의 에스크로 조건이 요구됩니다. "
