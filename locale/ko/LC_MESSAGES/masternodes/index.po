"Dash is best known as the first cryptocurrency with a focus on anonymity "
"and transaction speed. What many people do not know is that these "
"features are implemented on top of a network of dedicated servers known "
"as masternodes, which gives rise to many exciting features not available "
"on conventional blockchains. These features include anonymous and instant"
" transactions, as well as governance of the development of the Dash "
"network through a monthly budget and voting. This in itself is a first in"
" the crypto world, and the masternodes are necessary to achieve the "
"privacy and speed that Dash offers."
