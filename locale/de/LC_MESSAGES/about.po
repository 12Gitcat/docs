"Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused "
"cryptocurrency in the world. The Dash network features :ref:`instant "
"transaction confirmation <instantsend>`, double spend protection, anonymity "
"equal to that of physical cash, a self-governing, :ref:`self-funding model "
"<budget-system>` driven by :ref:`incentivized full nodes <masternode-"
"network>` and a `clear roadmap <https://github.com/dashpay/dash-roadmap>`__ "
"for on-chain scaling to up to 400MB blocks using custom-developed open "
"source hardware. While Dash is based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key"
" components of the Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-tier network structure offers "
"significant improvements in transaction speed, anonymity and governance. "
"This section of the documentation describes these and many more key features"
" that set Dash apart in the blockchain economy. For full details, please "
"read the `Dash whitepaper "
"<https://github.com/dashpay/dash/wiki/Whitepaper>`__."
