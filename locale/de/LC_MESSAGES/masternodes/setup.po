"A VPS, more commonly known as a cloud server, is fully functional "
"installation of an operating system (usually Linux) operating within a "
"virtual machine. The virtual machine allows the VPS provider to run multiple"
" systems on one physical server, making it more efficient and much cheaper "
"than having a single operating system running on the \"bare metal\" of each "
"server. A VPS is ideal for hosting a Dash masternode because they typically "
"offer guaranteed uptime, redundancy in the case of hardware failure and a "
"static IP address that is required to ensure you remain in the masternode "
"payment queue. While running a masternode from home on a desktop computer is"
" technically possible, it will most likely not work reliably because most "
"ISPs allocate dynamic IP addresses to home users."
