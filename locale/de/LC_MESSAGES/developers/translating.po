"Translations of all Dash products are managed courtesy of Transifex, which "
"offers its own detailed documentation of all functions and features. Within "
"Transifex, Dash maintains an organization which contains multiple projects "
"and one team of translators assigned to all of the projects. Each project is"
" assigned with one or more target languages for translation by the project "
"maintainer. When a translator joins the team, they are able to choose the "
"languages they feel able to translate. They can then work on any projects "
"specifying this language as a target language."

"In general, languages with minimal regional variation are to be translated "
"into the common language (rather than regional) target. Portuguese, for "
"example, is simply translated into the ``pt`` target language, rather than "
"two separate target languages ``pt_BR`` and ``pt_PT``, for Portuguese as "
"spoken in Brazil and Portugal, respectively. As Dash grows, these languages "
"may be separated out into their regional variants by proofreaders, depending"
" on demand. Exceptions to this rule apply where the same spoken language is "
"written differently, such as ``zh_CN`` and ``zh_TW`` for Simplified Chinese "
"and Traditional Chinese."

"Keeping translations consistent over time as multiple translators work on "
"each target language is a very important part of delivering a quality user "
"experience. For this reason, if you come across any Dash-specific "
"terminology such as `masternodes`, you should use the **Concordance** search"
" function to see how the term has been translated in the past. Transifex "
"will also provide **Suggestions** and **History** if it recognizes a similar"
" string in the database of past translations. Stay consistent with past "
"language use, but also ensure your terminology is up to date with current "
"use!"

"integrated in the next release. Note that the software will often replace "

" see a placeholder in the source text, it must also appear in the target "
"text. If it does not, your translation cannot be used. The **Copy source "
