"Whenever you are storing objects with a market value, security is necessary."
" This applies to barter systems as well as economies using currency as a "
"medium of exchange. While banks store balances on a private ledger, "
"cryptocurrencies store balances under unique addresses on a distributed "
"public ledger. The cryptographic private keys to access the balance stored "
"on each public address are therefore the object of value in this system. "
"This section of the documentation discusses different practical methods of "
"keeping these keys safe in wallets, while still remaining useful for day-to-"
"day needs."
msgstr ""
"Wenn du Objekte lagerst, die einen Marktwert haben, ist die Sicherheit von "
"hoher Bedeutung. Dies gilt in Gesellschaften, die auf Tauschhandel beruhen, "
"genauso, wie in jenen, die eine Währung als Zahlungsmittel verwenden. Banken"
" speichern die Guthaben ihrer Kunden in einer privaten Datenbank, während "
"Kryptowährungen die Guthaben unikalen Adressen zuschreiben, die in eine "
"öffentliche Datenbank eingeschrieben sind. Die kryptographischen privaten "
"Schlüssel, welche den Zugang zu diesen öffentlichen Adressen ermöglichen, "
"sind das Objekt, welches einen Wert hat. Dieses Kapitel der Dokumentation "
"behandelt Sicherheitsmaßnahmen, durch welche diese Schlüssel sicher in "
"Wallets aufbewahrt und dennoch für den alltäglichen Verbrauch verwendet "
"werden können."

"For safety, it is not recommended to store significant funds on exchanges or"
" software wallets. If you are holding cryptocurrency worth more than the "
"device you use to store it, you should purchase a :ref:`hardware wallet "
"<hardware-wallets>`."
msgstr ""
"Aus Sicherheitsgründen wird empfohlen, dass größere Beträge nicht auf "
"Handelsplattformen oder in Software Wallets gelagert werden. Falls du mehr "
"Kryptowährungen besitzt, als das Gerät, auf dem diese gelagert werden, wert "
"ist, solltest du darüber nachdenken eine :ref:`Hardware Wallet <hardware-"

"Dash Core Wallet is the full official release of Dash, and supports all Dash"
" features as they are released, including InstantSend and PrivateSend, as "
"well as an RPC console and governance features. Dash Core Wallet (sometimes "
"known as the QT wallet, due to the QT software framework used in "
"development) is a professional or heavy wallet which downloads the full "
"blockchain (several GB in size) and can operate as both a full node or "
"masternode on the network. Because of the requirement to hold a full copy of"
" the blockchain, some time is required for synchronisation when starting the"
" wallet. Once this is done, the correct balances will be displayed and the "
"functions in the wallet can be used. Dash Core Wallet is available for "
"macOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi and Windows."

"A hardware wallet is a type of device which stores private keys for a "
