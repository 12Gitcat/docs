"This document describes how to use Dash Core to send Dash anonymously. "
"PrivateSend, released as DarkSend in RC4 of the DarkCoin client and "
"rebranded to PrivateSend in May 2016, is a trustless method of running a "
"sequence of transactions (known as \"mixing\") such that an external "
"observer is unable to determine the source of funding when a PrivateSend "
"transaction is created. This gives your Dash the same anonymous properties "
"as cash withdrawn from an ATM, for example. The mixing and denomination "
"process is seamless, automatic, and requires no intervention on the part of "
"the user. The current implementation of PrivateSend in the Dash Core wallet "
"allows any amount of Dash to be mixed for later use in PrivateSend "
"transactions."

"Every 10 blocks, user clients network-wide will send any unmixed, traceable "
"DASH in their possession through an anonymization phase. In this phase, "
"masternodes are used in chained succession to mix the coins they receive "
"from the network and break them down into homogenous denominations."

"Depending on the desired depth of security and privacy, users may select "
"between 2 and 8 “hops” to successive masternodes before their coins are sent"
" back to the client. Hops are made every 10 blocks, so anonymization at a "
"depth of 2 hops will take 2*2.5=5.0 minutes, 3 hops 3*2.5=7.5 minutes, and "
"so on. The desired mixing depth can be selected in the client GUI."

"At the end of the anonymization phase, the user’s coins are returned to "
