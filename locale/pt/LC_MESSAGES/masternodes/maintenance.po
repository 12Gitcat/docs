"Periodically, the Dash Core development team will release updates to Dash. "
"Since normal nodes rely on them for services and copies of the blockchain, "
"masternodes are expected to update to new versions of Dash and Sentinel "
"promptly. In some cases, hardware upgrades (more CPU, RAM or disk space, or "
"even custom GPU/ASIC hardware) may also be necessary. Not updating will "
"eventually result in your masternode being removed from the payment queue. "
"If you run a hosted masternode, your host will take care of updates for you."
" If not, the method of updating depends on how you installed Dash."

#: ../../masternodes/maintenance.rst:32
msgid ""
"Minor version updates to Dash (e.g. from 0.12.3.1 to 0.12.3.2) do not make "
"changes to the protocol version, while major version updates (e.g. from "
"0.12.2.3 to 0.12.3.0) will usually increase the network protocol version. If"
" the protocol version did not change, you DO NOT need to restart your "
"masternode if you complete the update within 60 minutes. If the protocol "
"version did change, you must issue a start command from your wallet. Do not "
"send start commands to your masternode if not necessary, as it will send you"
" to the back of the payment queue."
