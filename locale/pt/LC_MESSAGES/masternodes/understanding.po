"Masternodes, once unique to the Dash network, are now becoming popular as "
"the technology is forked into other blockchains. This section of the "
"documentation describes the principles and mechanisms of masternodes and the"
" services they provide to the Dash network specifically."

"Simply put, a masternode is a server with a full copy of the Dash "
"blockchain, which guarantees a certain minimum level of performance and "
"functionality to perform certain tasks related to block validation, as well "
"as PrivateSend and InstantSend, as the anonymity and instant transaction "
"features in Dash are called. The masternodes are paid for this service, "
"using a concept known as Proof of Service. This is in addition to the Proof "
"of Work done by miners to secure the blockchain. Masternodes are also "
"allowed to vote on :ref:`governance and funding proposals <governance>`, "
"with each masternode receiving one vote (yes/no/abstain) on each proposal "
"submitted to the system."

"Anyone can run a masternode. The objective is to have enough "
"decentralization to ensure that no single person controls a significant "
"fraction of the masternodes. However, to avoid bloating the network with "
"unnecessary masternodes or encouraging reckless operators, there is one "
"condition that needs to be fulfilled: proof of ownership of 1000 Dash. The "
"coins don't need to be in the masternode, but they need to be kept in a "
"certain way that is transparent to the entire network. If the owner moves or"
" spends those coins, the masternode stops working and payment ceases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../masternodes/understanding.rst:43
msgid ""
"Masternodes are paid by the network for the PrivateSend, InstantSend and "
"governance services they provide. 45% of the block reward is paid out to the"
" masternodes, 45% to miners and 10% to the budget. In practice, half of the "
"reward from a normal block goes to the miner and half to the masternode. "
"Then, every 16,616 blocks (approximately 30.29 days), a superblock is "
"created that contains the entire 10% payout to the budget proposal winners. "
"Masternodes are randomly selected for payment in each block (approximately "
"every 2.6 minutes) from a list once they reach the top 10% of the total "
"count of masternodes, and moved to the back of the list after payment. As "
"more masternodes are created, the duration between payments increases. Due "
"to the selection algorithm, there is always an aspect of randomness to "
"payment selection, but in the long term all masternode owners should receive"
" similar payments. If the collateral behind a masternode is spent, or if a "
"masternode stops providing services to the network for more than one hour, "
"it is removed from the list until normal service resumes. In this way, "
"masternodes are given incentive to provide efficient and reliable services "
"to the network."

"Having so many servers holding a full copy of the blockchain and working for"
" the coin can be extremely useful. Thanks to the reward system, there is no "
"risk of not having enough masternodes, and the developers can rely on them "
"quickly deploying any new decentralized feature they want to implement. This"
" is where the true strength of Dash lies - an incentivized system of "
"thousands of distributed servers working 24x7 means that Dash can scale more"
" efficiently and deploy services more quickly than a blockchain run entirely"
" by unpaid volunteers. The more masternodes, the better and safer the Dash "
"network."

"Dash, like Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, is based on a "
"decentralized ledger of all transactions, known as a blockchain. This "
"blockchain is secured through a consensus mechanism; in the case of both "
"Dash and Bitcoin, the consensus mechanism is Proof of Work (PoW). "
":ref:`Miners <mining>` attempt to solve difficult problems with specialized "
"computers, and when they solve the problem, they receive the right to add a "
"new block to the blockchain. If all the other people running the software "
"agree that the problem was solved correctly, the block is added to the "
"blockchain and the miner is rewarded."

"Dash works a little differently from Bitcoin, however, because it has a two-"
"tier network. The second tier is powered by masternodes (Full Nodes), which "
"enable financial privacy (PrivateSend), instant transactions (InstantSend), "
"and the decentralized governance and budget system. Because this second tier"
" is so important, masternodes are also rewarded when miners discover new "
"blocks. The breakdown is as follows: 45% of the block reward goes to the "
"miner, 45% goes to masternodes, and 10% is reserved for the budget system "
"(created by superblocks every month)."

"The masternode system is referred to as Proof of Service (PoSe), since the "
"masternodes provide crucial services to the network. In fact, the entire "
"network is overseen by the masternodes, which have the power to reject "
"improperly formed blocks from miners. If a miner tried to take the entire "
"block reward for themselves or tried to run an old version of the Dash "
"software, the masternode network would orphan that block, and it would not "
"be added to the blockchain."
msgstr ""
"O sistema masternode é referido como Prova de Serviço (PoSe), uma vez que os"
" masternodes fornecem serviços cruciais para a rede. De fato, toda a rede é "
"supervisionada pelos masternodes, que têm o poder de rejeitar os blocos mal "
"formados dos mineiros. Se um mineiro tentasse levar a recompensa do bloco "

"In short, miners power the first tier, which is the basic sending and "
"receiving of funds and prevention of doublespending. Masternodes power the "
"second tier, which provide the added features that make Dash different from "
"other cryptocurrencies. Masternodes do not mine, and mining computers cannot"
" serve as masternodes. Additionally, each masternode is “secured” by 1000 "
"DASH. Those DASH remain under the sole control of their owner at all times, "
"and can still be freely spent. The funds are not locked in any way. However,"
" if the funds are moved or spent, the associated masternode will go offline "
"and stop receiving rewards."
msgstr ""
"Em suma, os mineradores tem poder a primeira camada, que é o básico de envio"

"poder da segunda camada, que fornecem os recursos adicionais que tornam a "
"Dash diferente de outros criptomoedas. E computadores de mineração não podem"
" servir como masternodes. Além disso, cada masternode é \"protegido\" por "
"1000 DASH. Essas DASH permaneçam sob o controle exclusivo de seu "
"proprietário em todos os momentos e ainda pode ser gasto livremente. Os "

"Every masternode appears in the global list. Their position in this list is "

"receiving payment are placed at the end of the list. Running, active "
"masternodes which are restarted using the rpc commands 'masternode start' or"
" 'masternode start-alias' are also placed at the end of the list. Using the "
"new rpc command 'masternode start-missing' avoids this. As masternodes are "
"moved to the end of the global list, the remaining masternodes slowly "
"migrate towards the top of the list. Once a masternode reaches the top 10% "

"The selection pool is the top 10% of the global list.  Its size is "
"determined by the total masternode count. As an example, if there are 4500 "
"active masternodes, the top 450 masternodes in the global list are eligible "
"for selection. Once in the selection pool, selection for payment is "
"determined by block hash entropy. The block hash 100 blocks ago determines "
"which masternode will be selected for payment. A double SHA256 of the "
"funding transaction hash and index for all masternodes in the selection pool"
" is compared with the proof of work hash 100 blocks ago. The masternode with"
" the closest numeric hash value to that block hash is selected for payment."

msgid "Probabilities"
msgstr ""

#: ../../masternodes/understanding.rst:170
msgid ""
"Because selection is determined by block hash entropy, it is impossible to "
"predict when a payment will occur. Masternode operators should expect "
"considerable variance in payment intervals over time. Once a masternode "
"enters the selection pool, payments become a probability. The probabilities "
"in this example are calculated using an assumed current pool size of 450 (at"
" 4500 total masternodes). Nodes in the selection pool are selected for "
"rewards randomly, i.e. the probability of being selected on any given block "
"is 1/450."
msgstr ""

#: ../../masternodes/understanding.rst:179
msgid ""
"The table below shows the probably of an eligible node being selected for "
"payment over a particular period of time. For example, the probability that "
"an eligible node is selected within 12 hours is about 46%. The table does "
"**not** (and cannot) tell us the probability of being selected **after** a "
"given period of time. For example, if you haven’t been selected within the "
"past 12 hours — and we know from this table there is about a 54% chance of "
"that happening — the probability of being selected on the next block is "
"**not** 46%. It remains 1/450. Putting these together, if you have an "
"eligible node, and, say, 48 hours have passed without payment, then you’ve "
"been very unlucky, as there’s less than a 10% chance of that happening. But,"
