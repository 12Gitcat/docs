"Whenever you are storing objects with a market value, security is "
"necessary. This applies to barter systems as well as economies using "
"currency as a medium of exchange. While banks store balances on a private"
" ledger, cryptocurrencies store balances under unique addresses on a "
"distributed public ledger. The cryptographic private keys to access the "
"balance stored on each public address are therefore the object of value "
"in this system. This section of the documentation discusses different "
"practical methods of keeping these keys safe in wallets, while still "
"remaining useful for day-to-day needs."

"Dash Core Wallet is the full official release of Dash, and supports all "
"Dash features as they are released, including InstantSend and "
"PrivateSend, as well as an RPC console and governance features. Dash Core"
" Wallet (sometimes known as the QT wallet, due to the QT software "
"framework used in development) is a professional or heavy wallet which "
"downloads the full blockchain (several GB in size) and can operate as "
"both a full node or masternode on the network. Because of the requirement"
" to hold a full copy of the blockchain, some time is required for "
"synchronisation when starting the wallet. Once this is done, the correct "
"balances will be displayed and the functions in the wallet can be used. "
"Dash Core Wallet is available for macOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi and Windows."

"A hardware wallet is a type of device which stores private keys for a "
"blockchain in a secure hardware device, instead of in a database file "
"such as wallet.dat used with common software wallets. This offers major "
"security advantages over software wallets, as well as practical benefits "
"over paper wallets. To date, there is no verifiable evidence of hardware "
"wallets being compromised by viruses, and they are also immune to "
"keylogger attacks that could be used to steal passwords to unlock the "
"private keys used with software wallets."

msgid ""
"Hardware wallets function by storing your private keys in a protected "
"area of a microcontroller. It is impossible for the private key to leave "
"the device in plain text - only the signed output of the cryptographic "
"hash is ever transmitted to the device interacting with the blockchain, "
"such as your computer or smartphone. Most hardware wallets feature a "
"screen which allows you to independently confirm the address you are "
"sending to is correct."
