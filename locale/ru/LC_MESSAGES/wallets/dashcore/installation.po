"These videos show how to download, verify the checksum and install the Dash "
"Core Wallet on Linux, macOS and Windows systems. While they are somewhat out"
" of date, the procedure is still largely the same. The main difference is "
"that the official Dash website is now https://www.dash.org/ rather than "
"https://www.dashpay.io/ as stated in the videos, although the old site will "
"redirect you to the new one. Also, in later versions of Dash Core, "
"application data such as the blockchain is now stored in the \"DashCore\" "
"rather than \"Dash\" folder."
