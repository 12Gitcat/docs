"The Dash protocol and many Dash products such as Dash Core and the mobile "
"wallets are entirely open source, which makes it easy for third parties to "
"integrate Dash with their existing cryptocurrency wallet solutions. This "
"section describes some of the third party wallets available and the "
"functions they offer. Please note that Dash does not provide support for any"
" of these wallets, and any listing here should not be considered an "
"endorsement or recommendation. Contact the software vendor for support."
