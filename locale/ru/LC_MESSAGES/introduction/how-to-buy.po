"Exchanges_ are one of the most popular ways to trade cryptocurrency. A wide "
"range of exchanges exist, each offering slightly different features. Some "
"serve different markets, some are in direct competition, some have cheaper "
"fees, and some are subject to more or less strict regulatory requirements. "
"Most exchanges are centralized, meaning they are operated by a single "
"company, which may be obliged by the laws of the jurisdiction in which it "
"operates to collect data on its customers. Others are decentralized, but as "
"a result have higher escrow requirements since you are dealing peer-to- peer"
" instead of with a trusted entity. Exchanges can be broadly broken down into"
" two categories: exchanges which accept national currency (fiat money) and "
"exchanges which deal in cryptocurrencies only."

"`Instant exchanges <instant_exchanges>`_ perform a similar function to "
"normal exchanges, but without the requirement to log in. They effectively "
"convert one currency to another, with some limits on the amount to be "
"exchanged and usually at a less advantageous rate. Others may even offer to "
"sell cryptocurrency as a credit card purchase."

"`Peer-to-peer exchanges <peer_to_peer>`_ have recently appeared to "
"facilitate trading ofDash directly between individuals. Volume is often "
"lower, and users typically make offers or requests at the price they are "
"willing to pay, and wait for someone to contact them and arrange details of "
"the sale. More advanced peer-to- peer sites offer escrow services for a fee "
"to prevent cheating during the sale between two parties who have never met."

"ATMs_ accepting card and cash payments in return for crypto are widely "
"available. Mapping services can show the specific location of these "
"machines, or you can even set one up at your own business and earn a "
